to remove all files and subdirectories inside it		- rm -rf /home/ec2-user/pg_backup/*
to delete hidden files (those starting with a dot)		- rm -rf /home/ec2-user/pg_backup/{*,.*}
to remove the entire directory and recreate it (best for a completely clean backup location): 	rm -rf /home/ec2-user/pg_backup
																																					mkdir /home/ec2-user/pg_backup

To delete all files and subdirectories (including hidden ones) from your current directory 		- rm -rf ./*
																																				- rm -rf ./.*
to delete everything (including hidden files and folders): 	rm -rf .[!.]* *
to rename a file / directory		- mv existing_name new_name

													- truncate -s 0 filename

to copy files from one dir to other:
		SYNTAX: cp -r /source/folder /destination/
		Ex: cp -r /home/ec2-user/pg_backup/* /var/lib/pgsql/17/data/
	
		cp: copy files & directories
		-r:  It tells the cp command to copy directories recursively, 
			meaning it will copy not only files but also all subdirectories and their contents inside the specified directory
			Without -r, cp can only copy individual files, not directories.

	PATHS IN THE SERVER:
		bin folder		- /usr/pgsql-17/bin/
		data folder	- /var/lib/pgsql/17/data/
		
		To access this directory, you need to use superuser (root) privileges or switch to the PostgreSQL user (usually postgres):
			switch to postgres user: 		sudo -i -u postgres
			to exit from postgres user 	exit
