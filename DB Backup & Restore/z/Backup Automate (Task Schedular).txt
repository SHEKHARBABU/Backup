TO AUTOMATE THE FULLBACKUP PROCESS ALONG WITH THE TIMESTAMP USING .BAT FILE AND TASK SCHEDULAR

create a .bat file with some random text in it, as it will not be created empty using CMD, as it is not possible to create directly in C drive
	- echo abdsd > backup.bat

now write the CMD script to extract date, time and pg_basebackup command in it

we can run it direct by its file name in CMD where the file is located or we can double click it to open
	C:\>backup.bat
	here .bat file is in C drive
